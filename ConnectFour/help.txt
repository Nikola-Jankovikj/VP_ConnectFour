Here's a simple guide with instructions on how to play the game Connect Four.

Overview: 
Connect Four is a two-player strategy game played on a grid of rows and columns. The goal is to be the first player to connect four of your own colored circles in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

Gameplay: 
The game always begins with the player using the red circles. Players take turns dropping one circle at a time into any of the columns in the grid. The circles will occupy the lowest available empty space in the chosen column.

Connecting Four: 
The objective is to connect four of your own colored circles in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The row can be formed in any direction: up and down, side to side, or diagonally. The first player to achieve this wins the game.

Alternate Turns: 
Players take turns placing one circle at a time until the grid is completely filled or until one player connects four circles in a row. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game is a draw. If a player successfully connects four of their colored circles, they win the game!

Strategy Tips: 
Here are a few tips to improve your gameplay:
Pay attention to your opponent's moves to block potential winning moves.
Try to create multiple possible winning moves to increase your chances of winning.
Focus on creating horizontal or vertical connections rather than relying solely on diagonal ones.
Control the center column as it provides more opportunities for different connections.

Remember, Connect Four is a game that requires both strategic planning and adaptability. Enjoy the game and have fun!
